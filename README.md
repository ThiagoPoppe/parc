# Polyphonic Audio to Roman Corpus

Polyphonic Audio to Roman Corpus (PARC) is a new dataset specifically designed for Roman Numeral Analysis (RNA) on polyphonic audio recordings, inspired by the dataset used by the [SheetSage model](https://github.com/chrisdonahue/sheetsage?tab=readme-ov-file#hooktheory-dataset). Constructed from data sourced from [HookTheory's TheoryTab DB](https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab), PARC offers time-aligned crowd-sourced RNA annotations for real-world audio tracks that capture the complexity of overlapping instruments, vocals, and background noise. Beyond its core annotations, the dataset is enriched with metadata, including musical genres spanning pop, rock, and jazz, harmonic-based complexity ratings, and predefined splits suitable for training and evaluating Deep Learning models.

PARC dataset contains annotations for 20.324 TheoryTabs, the name given to an annotated song section in HookTheory, of 11.783 unique recordings, totaling \approx 128 hours of labeled audio. However, the whole dataset contains 54,068 TheoryTabs of 29,437 unique recordings of labeled data with and without available audio, which can be accessed by this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WqJFGo5lJEru4Qh5dqYd41Fbh-DcHbtf?usp=sharing). Alongside, each annotation is has an associated NLLS-Chroma and Semitone Spectrum features at a 32nd beat resolution. PARC also has annotations for songs in other keys, spanning the 7 major modes (major/ionian, dorian, phrygian, lydian, mixolydian, minor/aeolian, and locrian), and both harmonic minor and phrygian dominant scales.

## Licensing considerations
As well as disclaimed by the authors [SheetSage](https://github.com/chrisdonahue/sheetsage?tab=readme-ov-file#hooktheory-dataset), which also uses HookTheory data, while all of the code in this repository is released under a permissive MIT license, all **code** in this repository is MIT-licensed, but the dataset is distributed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0, as they are derived from user contributions on HookTheory (see https://forum.hooktheory.com/tos for more details).
